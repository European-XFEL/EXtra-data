EXtra-data
==========

**EXtra-data** is a Python library for accessing saved data
produced at `European XFEL <https://www.xfel.eu/>`_.

Installation
------------

EXtra-data is available on our Anaconda installation on the Maxwell cluster::

    module load exfel exfel_anaconda3

You can also install it `from PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/EXtra-data/>`__
to use in other environments with Python 3.6 or later::

    pip install extra_data

If you get a permissions error, add the ``--user`` flag to that command.

Quickstart
----------

Open a run on the Maxwell cluster::

    from extra_data import open_run

    run = open_run(proposal=700000, run=1)

You can also specify a run directory, or open an individual file - see
:ref:`opening-files` for details. The same methods to access data work with any
of these options.

Load data as a NumPy array for a given source & key::

    arr = run["SA3_XTD10_PES/ADC/1:network", "digitizers.channel_4_A.raw.samples"].ndarray()

You can load only a region of interest, get a labelled array with train IDs,
or load 1D data as columns in a pandas dataframe. See :doc:`xpd_examples`
(example) and :ref:`data-by-source-and-key` (reference) for more information.

For data that's too big to fit in memory at once, you can read one pulse train
at a time::

    for train_id, data in run.select("*/DET/*", "image.data").trains():
        mod0 = data["FXE_DET_LPD1M-1/DET/0CH0:xtdf"]["image.data"]

Other options to work with large data volumes include breaking the run into
smaller parts with :meth:`~.DataCollection.split_trains` before loading data,
and automatic chunking with the `Dask <https://dask.org/>`_ framework and
:meth:`~.dask_array`.
